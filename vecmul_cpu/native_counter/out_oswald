|            Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbos 0 counter,|
|             this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information|
|             by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0. The f|
|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|
|            ly monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entryy.     |

| bdx_unc_cbo0::UNC_C_RING_AD_USED                                             |
|            Counts the number of cycles that the AD ring is being used at this|
|             ring stop.  This includes when packets are passing by and when pa|
|            ckets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being |
|            sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in BDX -- a clo|
|            ckwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the|
|             ring, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the |
|            counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is re|
|            versed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ri|
|            ng, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other |
|            words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same rin|
|            g as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the rhe rin|

|            Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbos 0 counter,|

|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|
|            ly monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entryy.     |

| bdx_unc_cbo1::UNC_C_RING_AD_USED                                             |
|            Counts the number of cycles that the AD ring is being used at this|
|             ring stop.  This includes when packets are passing by and when pa|
|            ckets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being |
|            sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in BDX -- a clo|
|            ckwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the|
|             ring, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the |
|            counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is re|
|            versed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ri|
|            ng, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other |
|            words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same rin|
|            g as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the rhe rin|

|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|

|            Counts the number of cycles that the AD ring is being used at this|
|             ring stop.  This includes when packets are passing by and when pa|
|            ckets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being |
|            sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in BDX -- a clo|
|            ckwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the|
|             ring, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the |
|            counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is re|
|            versed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ri|
|            ng, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other |
|            words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same rin|
|            g as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the rhe rin|

|            Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbos 0 counter,|

|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|

|             ring stop.  This includes when packets are passing by and when pa|
|            ckets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being |
|            sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in BDX -- a clo|
|            ckwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the|
|             ring, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the |
|            counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is re|
|            versed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ri|
|            ng, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other |

|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|

|            Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbos 0 counter,|
|             this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information|
|             by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0. The f|
|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|
|            ly monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entryy.     |

|            Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbos 0 counter,|
|             this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information|
|             by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0. The f|
|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|
|            ly monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entryy.     |

|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|

|            ckwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the|

|            Counts the number of cycles that the BL ring is being used at this|
|             ring stop.  This includes when packets are passing by and when pa|
|            ckets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being |
|            sent from the ring stop.We really have two rings in BDX -- a clock|
|            wise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the r|
|            ing, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the co|
|            unter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reve|
|            rsed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring|
|            , and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other wo|
|            rds (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring |
|            as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the rhe ring.|

|            Counts the number of cycles that the BL ring is being used at this|

|            sent from the ring stop.We really have two rings in BDX -- a clock|
|            wise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the r|
|            ing, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the co|
|            unter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reve|
|            rsed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring|
|            , and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other wo|
|            rds (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring |
|            as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the rhe ring.|

|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|

|            sent from the ring stop.We really have two rings in BDX -- a clock|
|            wise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the r|
|            ing, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the co|
|            unter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reve|
|            rsed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring|
|            , and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other wo|
|            rds (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring |
|            as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the rhe ring.|

|            For each cycle, this event accumulates the number of valid entries|
|             in the TOR that match qualifications specified by the subevent.  |
|             There are a number of subevent filters but only a subset of the s|
|            ubevent combinations are valid.  Subevents that require an opcode |
|            or NID match require the Cn_MSR_PMON_BOX_FILTER.{opc, nid} field t|
|            o be set.  If, for example, one wanted to count DRD Local Misses, |
|            one should select MISS_OPC_MATCH and set Cn_MSR_PMON_BOX_FILTER.op|

|            Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbos 0 counter,|
|             this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information|
|             by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0. The f|
|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|

|            sent from the ring stop.We really have two rings in BDX -- a clock|
|            wise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the r|
|            ing, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the co|
|            unter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reve|
|            rsed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring|
|            , and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other wo|
|            rds (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring |

|            For each cycle, this event accumulates the number of valid entries|
|             in the TOR that match qualifications specified by the subevent.  |
|             There are a number of subevent filters but only a subset of the s|
|            ubevent combinations are valid.  Subevents that require an opcode |

|            Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbos 0 counter,|
|             this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information|
|             by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0. The f|
|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|
|            ly monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entryy.     |

|            wise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the r|
|            ing, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the co|
|            unter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reve|
|            rsed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring|
|            , and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other wo|
|            rds (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring |

|            Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbos 0 counter,|
|             this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information|
|             by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0. The f|
|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|
|            ly monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entryy.     |

|            Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbos 0 counter,|
|             this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information|
|             by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0. The f|
|            iltering available is found in the control register - threshold, i|
|            nvert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effective|
|            ly monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entryy.     |

| bdx_unc_cbo15::UNC_C_RING_AD_USED                                            |
|            Counts the number of cycles that the AD ring is being used at this|
|             ring stop.  This includes when packets are passing by and when pa|
|            ckets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being |
|            sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in BDX -- a clo|
|            ckwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the|
|             ring, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the |
|            counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is re|
|            versed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ri|
|            ng, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other |
|            words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same rin|
|            g as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the rhe rin|

|            sent from the ring stop.  There is only 1 IV ring in BDX  Therefor|
|            e, if one wants to monitor the Even ring, they should select both |

|            edit for the iMCs RPQ (read pending queue).  This queue is broken |
|            into regular credits/buffers that are used by general reads, and s|
|            pecial requests such as ISOCH reads.  This count only tracks the r|
|            egular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to m|
|            ake use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (a|
|            nd uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers a|
|            t the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller ch|
|            annel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given iven time. |

|            Counts the number of cycles when there are no regular credits avai|
|            lable for posting writes from the HA into the iMC.  In order to se|
|            nd writes into the memory controller, the HA must first acquire a |
|            credit for the iMCs WPQ (write pending queue).  This queue is brok|
|            en into regular credits/buffers that are used by general writes, a|
|            nd special requests such as ISOCH writes.  This count only tracks |
|            the regular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able|
|             to make use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficu|
|            lt (and uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buff|
|            ers at the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controll|

|            edit for the iMCs RPQ (read pending queue).  This queue is broken |
|            into regular credits/buffers that are used by general reads, and s|
|            pecial requests such as ISOCH reads.  This count only tracks the r|
|            egular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to m|
|            ake use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (a|
|            nd uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers a|
|            t the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller ch|
|            annel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given iven time. |

|            Number of cycles spent in CKE ON mode.  The filter allows you to s|

|            one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing|
|             accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track mu|
|            ltiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the |
|            different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined bas|

|            stem.  However, high priority requests can cause pages of active r|
|            equests to be closed in order to get them out.  This will reduce t|
|            he latency of the high-priority request at the expense of lower ba|
|            ndwidth and increased overall average latency.                    |

|            Counts the number of cycles that the Write Pending Queue is not em|
|            pty.  This can then be used to calculate the average queue occupan|
|            cy (in conjunction with the WPQ Occupancy Accumulation count).  Th|
|            e WPQ is used to schedule write out to the memory controller and t|
|            o track the writes.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after the|
|            y enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in th|
|            is buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.  They dealloca|
|            te after being issued to DRAM.  Write requests themselves are able|
|             to complete (from the perspective of the rest of the system) as s|
|            oon they have posted to the iMC.  This is not to be confused with |
|            actually performing the write to DRAM.  Therefore, the average lat|

|            Number of cycles spent in CKE ON mode.  The filter allows you to s|

|             accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track mu|
|            ltiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the |

|            Counts the number of times a read in the iMC preempts another read|

|            quests to closed pages.  This improves the page hit rate of the sy|
|            stem.  However, high priority requests can cause pages of active r|
|            equests to be closed in order to get them out.  This will reduce t|
|            he latency of the high-priority request at the expense of lower ba|
|            ndwidth and increased overall average latency.                    |

|            Counts the number of cycles that the Write Pending Queue is not em|
|            pty.  This can then be used to calculate the average queue occupan|
|            cy (in conjunction with the WPQ Occupancy Accumulation count).  Th|
|            e WPQ is used to schedule write out to the memory controller and t|
|            o track the writes.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after the|
|            y enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in th|
|            is buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.  They dealloca|
|            te after being issued to DRAM.  Write requests themselves are able|
|             to complete (from the perspective of the rest of the system) as s|
|            oon they have posted to the iMC.  This is not to be confused with |

|            Number of cycles spent in CKE ON mode.  The filter allows you to s|

|            one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing|
|             accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track mu|
|            ltiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the |
|            different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined bas|

|            quests to closed pages.  This improves the page hit rate of the sy|
|            stem.  However, high priority requests can cause pages of active r|
|            equests to be closed in order to get them out.  This will reduce t|
|            he latency of the high-priority request at the expense of lower ba|
|            ndwidth and increased overall average latency.                    |

|            Counts the number of cycles that the Write Pending Queue is not em|
|            pty.  This can then be used to calculate the average queue occupan|
|            cy (in conjunction with the WPQ Occupancy Accumulation count).  Th|
|            e WPQ is used to schedule write out to the memory controller and t|
|            o track the writes.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after the|
|            y enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in th|
|            is buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.  They dealloca|
|            te after being issued to DRAM.  Write requests themselves are able|
|             to complete (from the perspective of the rest of the system) as s|
|            oon they have posted to the iMC.  This is not to be confused with |
|            actually performing the write to DRAM.  Therefore, the average lat|

|            Number of cycles spent in CKE ON mode.  The filter allows you to s|
|            elect a rank to monitor.  If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at |
|            one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing|
|             accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track mu|
|            ltiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the |
|            different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined bas|

|            stem.  However, high priority requests can cause pages of active r|
|            equests to be closed in order to get them out.  This will reduce t|
|            he latency of the high-priority request at the expense of lower ba|
|            ndwidth and increased overall average latency.                    |

|            Counts the number of cycles that the Write Pending Queue is not em|
|            pty.  This can then be used to calculate the average queue occupan|
|            cy (in conjunction with the WPQ Occupancy Accumulation count).  Th|
|            e WPQ is used to schedule write out to the memory controller and t|
|            o track the writes.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after the|
|            y enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in th|
|            is buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.  They dealloca|
|            te after being issued to DRAM.  Write requests themselves are able|
|             to complete (from the perspective of the rest of the system) as s|
|            oon they have posted to the iMC.  This is not to be confused with |
|            actually performing the write to DRAM.  Therefore, the average lat|

|            Accumulates the number of elements in the QPI RxQ in each cycle.  |
|            Generally, when data is transmitted across QPI, it will bypass the|
|             RxQ and pass directly to the ring interface.  If things back up g|
|            etting transmitted onto the ring, however, it may need to allocate|
|             into this buffer, thus increasing the latency.  This event can be|
|             used in conjunction with the Flit Buffer Not Empty event to calcu|
|            late average occupancy, or with the Flit Buffer Allocations event |
|            to track average lifetime.  This monitors SNP flits only.         |

|            Number of allocations into the QPI Tx Flit Buffer.  Generally, whe|
|            n data is transmitted across QPI, it will bypass the TxQ and pass |
|            directly to the link.  However, the TxQ will be used with L0p and |
|            when LLR occurs, increasing latency to transfer out to the link.  |
|            This event can be used in conjunction with the Flit Buffer Occupan|

|            Counts the number of times that an incoming flit was able to bypas|
|            s the flit buffer and pass directly across the BGF and into the Eg|
|            ress.  This is a latency optimization, and should generally be the|
|             common case.  If this value is less than the number of flits tran|
|            sfered, it implies that there was queueing getting onto the ring, |
|            and thus the transactions saw higher latency.                     |

|            Accumulates the number of elements in the QPI RxQ in each cycle.  |
|            Generally, when data is transmitted across QPI, it will bypass the|
|             RxQ and pass directly to the ring interface.  If things back up g|
|            etting transmitted onto the ring, however, it may need to allocate|
|             into this buffer, thus increasing the latency.  This event can be|
|             used in conjunction with the Flit Buffer Not Empty event to calcu|
|            late average occupancy, or with the Flit Buffer Allocations event |
|            to track average lifetime.  This monitors SNP flits only.         |

|            Number of allocations into the QPI Tx Flit Buffer.  Generally, whe|
|            n data is transmitted across QPI, it will bypass the TxQ and pass |
|            directly to the link.  However, the TxQ will be used with L0p and |
|            when LLR occurs, increasing latency to transfer out to the link.  |

|            Number of times a request failed to acquire a DRS VN0 credit.  In |
|            order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guara|
|            nteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  Th|
|            ere are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used |
|            to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries fo|
|            r each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests fi|
|            rst attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if |
|            they fail.  This therefore counts the number of times when a reque|
|            st failed to acquire either a VNA or VN0 credit and is delayed.  T|

|            Number of QPI VNA Credit acquisitions.  This event can be used in |
|            conjunction with the VNA In-Use Accumulator to calculate the avera|
|            ge lifetime of a credit holder.  VNA credits are used by all messa|
|            ge classes in order to communicate across QPI.  If a packet is una|
|            ble to acquire credits, it will then attempt to use credts from th|
|            e VN0 pool.  Note that a single packet may require multiple flit b|
|            uffers (i.e. when data is being transfered).  Therefore, this even|
|            t will increment by the number of credits acquired in each cycle. |
|             Filtering based on message class is not provided.  One can count |

|            Number of attempted VNA credit acquisitions that were rejected bec|
|            ause the VNA credit pool was full (or almost full).  It is possibl|
|            e to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more th|
|            an one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  |
|            Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not|
|             fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bul|
|            k of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used t|
|            o guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the fli|
|            t buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  |

|            Number of times a request failed to acquire a DRS VN0 credit.  In |
|            order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guara|
|            nteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  Th|
|            ere are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used |
|            to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries fo|
|            r each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests fi|
|            rst attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if |
|            they fail.  This therefore counts the number of times when a reque|
|            st failed to acquire either a VNA or VN0 credit and is delayed.  T|
|            his should generally be a rare situation.                         |

|            Number of times a VN0 credit was used on the DRS message channel. |
|             In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be g|
|            uaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.|
|              There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool u|
|            sed to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entrie|
|            s for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Request|
|            s first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0|
|             if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN0 credit was u|
|            sed.  Note that a single VN0 credit holds access to potentially mu|
|            ltiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could |
|            use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on|
|             VN0 will only count a single credit even though it may use multip|

|            Number of attempted VNA credit acquisitions that were rejected bec|
|            ause the VNA credit pool was full (or almost full).  It is possibl|
|            e to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more th|
|            an one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  |
|            Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not|
|             fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bul|
|            k of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used t|
|            o guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the fli|
|            t buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  |
